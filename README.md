# About PaSELLubong

Our project proposal is called "PaSELLubong" a mobile e-commerce application intented to help indigeneous people sell their products with ease by connecting them directly with people who whish to buy their products. Our application diffrentiates itself from other e-commerce applications is that we intend to also educate our users about the products that they are buying. Each product will be accompanied with a detailed discription informing the buyers about the cultural significance and the history of the product. The application will also include promotional occasional games and quizzes that the users can participate in to recieve a discount on their purchases. These games and quizzes will also supplement our objective to help educate the users about the indigeneous people's products, history and rich culture.
